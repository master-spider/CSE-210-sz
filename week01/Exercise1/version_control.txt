WHAT IS VERSION CONTROL AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Version control is how a programmer keeps track of changes made in their program and
it is very important so that changes can be tracked.
Everytime a new change has been made to the program, the modified program is a newer version.
Version control makes it easier to track an error in your program because all modifications are tagged clearly.
For example an application used to print out receipts in a store can have a version which simply prints out
the store name, items bought, and the total amount to be paid. A modified version can print out the store name,
items bought, the total amount, the amount paid, the change if any, date and time of purchase and a thank you
message.
